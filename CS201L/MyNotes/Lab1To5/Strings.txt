Printing every 9 numbers
A U.S. social security number consists of a string  of 9 digits, such as "444422333". 
Assume  that input consists of a sequence of 9-digit social security numbers 
with no intervening spaces or separators  of any kind:
   111223333444422333123456789987654321...
Assume  that a char  array  named  ssn suitable for storing a social 
security number as a C-string  has been declared . Use this array  to read 
in 3 successive social security numbers and print each one out on a line by itself. 

for(int j=0; j<3; j++)
{	
	cin.get(ssn,10);
	for (int i = 0; i<9; i++)
	{	
	  cout << ssn[i];
	} 
	cout << "\n";
}
