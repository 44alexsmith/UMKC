Polymorphism
Let’s say we want to store a Shape variable. If we create it as a pointer:
We can fill that with any type of Shape object:
	Shape *myShape1, *myShape2;
	myShape1 = new Rectangle;
	myShape2 = new Triangle;
Rectangle and Triangle are both Shapes, so a pointer to a Shape can point to either one. Now, if we call area on either one:
	cout << myShape1.area();
	cout << myShape2.area();
They both are the exact same line, but one calls area() on a Rectangle object and one calls it on a Triangle object. Polymorphism is the ability to store a derived class in a variable of a base class.
