Maps
	map<type1, type2> variable_name;

Maps are similar to vectors in that you can add elements to them. However, they work in key-value pairs. type1 and type2 correspond to the types of data you want to associate. To store a list of moons, you can use the planet name as a key, and the name of the moon as a value. For example:
	map<string, string> moons;
	moons[“Mercury”] = “None”;
	moons[“Venus”] = “None”;
	moons[“Earth”] = “Moon”;
	moons[“Mars”] = “Deimos, Phobos”;

When you use iterators (below) with maps, the key is called first and the value is called second.

Iterators
	map<type1, type2>::iterator variable_name;
